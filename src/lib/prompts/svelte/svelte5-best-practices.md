# Svelte 5 Best Practices

## Code Organization
- Follow Svelte naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
- Organize imports: Svelte imports first, then third-party, then local
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

## Performance Considerations
- Use $derived for computed values instead of reactive statements
- Implement proper key blocks for dynamic lists
- Consider lazy loading for large components
- Use proper event delegation patterns

## Accessibility & UX
- Include proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Provide loading states and error boundaries
- Consider mobile responsiveness in all implementations

## Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries
- Provide clear error messages to users
- Include proper validation for forms and inputs
- Handle async operations gracefully
