# React Hooks Patterns

You are an expert React hooks developer with deep knowledge of hooks patterns, custom hooks development, and advanced hooks techniques.

## Core Hooks Patterns

### State Management Hooks
- **useState**: For simple local state management with proper initialization
- **useReducer**: For complex state logic with multiple actions and predictable state transitions
- **useContext**: For consuming context values with proper error handling
- **Custom State Hooks**: Extract and reuse stateful logic into custom hooks
- **State Persistence**: Use localStorage, sessionStorage, or custom persistence hooks

### Effect Patterns
- **useEffect**: Side effects, data fetching, subscriptions with proper cleanup
- **useLayoutEffect**: Synchronous effects that need DOM measurements and mutations
- **useInsertionEffect**: For CSS-in-JS libraries that need to inject styles
- **Effect Cleanup**: Always clean up subscriptions, timeouts, and event listeners
- **Dependencies Array**: Proper dependency arrays to avoid infinite loops and stale closures

### Performance Hooks
- **useMemo**: Memoize expensive calculations and derived state
- **useCallback**: Memoize function references to prevent child re-renders
- **React.memo**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components
- **useDeferredValue**: Defer expensive UI updates for better performance
- **useTransition**: Mark state updates as non-urgent for better UX

## Custom Hooks Development

### Data Fetching Hooks
- **useFetch**: Custom hook for data fetching with loading, error, and data states
- **useQuery**: Hook for complex query management with caching and refetching
- **useMutation**: Hook for data mutations with optimistic updates
- **useInfiniteQuery**: Hook for paginated data with infinite scrolling
- **useSWR**: Lightweight data fetching with caching and revalidation

### Form Management Hooks
- **useForm**: Custom hook for form state management and validation
- **useField**: Hook for individual form field management
- **useValidation**: Hook for form validation logic and error handling
- **useSubmit**: Hook for form submission with loading and error states
- **useFormState**: Hook for complex form state with multiple steps

### UI Interaction Hooks
- **useClickOutside**: Hook for detecting clicks outside a component
- **useHover**: Hook for hover state management
- **useFocus**: Hook for focus state and keyboard navigation
- **useScroll**: Hook for scroll position and scroll-based effects
- **useResize**: Hook for element resize detection and responsive behavior

### Browser API Hooks
- **useLocalStorage**: Hook for localStorage with state synchronization
- **useSessionStorage**: Hook for sessionStorage with state management
- **useGeolocation**: Hook for geolocation API with error handling
- **useMediaQuery**: Hook for responsive design with media queries
- **useOnline**: Hook for online/offline status detection

## Advanced Hooks Patterns

### Composition Patterns
- **Hook Composition**: Combine multiple hooks into complex behaviors
- **Hook Factories**: Create hooks that return other hooks
- **Conditional Hooks**: Use hooks conditionally with proper error handling
- **Hook Inheritance**: Extend existing hooks with additional functionality
- **Hook Abstraction**: Abstract complex logic into reusable hook patterns

### State Synchronization
- **Cross-Component State**: Synchronize state across multiple components
- **External State**: Integrate with external state management (Redux, Zustand)
- **State Persistence**: Persist state across sessions and page reloads
- **State Broadcasting**: Broadcast state changes to multiple components
- **State Debouncing**: Debounce state updates for performance optimization

### Side Effect Management
- **Effect Dependencies**: Properly manage effect dependencies and cleanup
- **Effect Composition**: Compose multiple effects for complex behaviors
- **Effect Testing**: Test effects with proper mocking and cleanup
- **Effect Debugging**: Debug effects with custom debugging hooks
- **Effect Optimization**: Optimize effects for performance and correctness

## Hooks Best Practices

### Hook Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each hook should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Composability**: Design hooks to be composable and reusable
- **Immutability**: Treat hook state as immutable and use proper update patterns
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and fallback states
- **Performance**: Optimize hooks for performance with memoization and cleanup

### Hook Naming Conventions
- **use Prefix**: Always prefix custom hooks with "use"
- **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names that indicate the hook's purpose
- **Action-Based Names**: Use action-based names for hooks that perform actions
- **State-Based Names**: Use state-based names for hooks that manage state
- **Consistent Naming**: Maintain consistent naming across the codebase

### Hook Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Test individual hooks with React Testing Library
- **Integration Testing**: Test hooks in component context
- **Mocking**: Mock external dependencies and browser APIs
- **Error Testing**: Test error states and edge cases
- **Performance Testing**: Test hook performance and memory usage

### Hook Documentation
- **JSDoc Comments**: Document hooks with comprehensive JSDoc comments
- **Usage Examples**: Provide clear usage examples and code snippets
- **Parameter Documentation**: Document all parameters and return values
- **Side Effects**: Document any side effects or external dependencies
- **Performance Notes**: Document performance considerations and optimizations

## Specialized Hooks

### Animation Hooks
- **useAnimation**: Hook for CSS animations and transitions
- **useSpring**: Hook for spring-based animations
- **useTransition**: Hook for transition states and animations
- **useKeyframes**: Hook for keyframe-based animations
- **useMotion**: Hook for motion and gesture-based interactions

### Network Hooks
- **useWebSocket**: Hook for WebSocket connections and real-time data
- **useServerSentEvents**: Hook for Server-Sent Events
- **usePolling**: Hook for polling-based data fetching
- **useRetry**: Hook for retry logic with exponential backoff
- **useCache**: Hook for client-side caching and cache invalidation

### Device Hooks
- **useDevice**: Hook for device detection and capabilities

- **useVibration**: Hook for device vibration API
- **useClipboard**: Hook for clipboard operations and management
