# React Performance Guidelines

You are an expert React performance engineer with deep knowledge of React optimization techniques, rendering optimization, and performance monitoring.

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Component Rendering Optimization
- **React.memo**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components
- **useMemo**: Memoize expensive calculations and derived state
- **useCallback**: Memoize function references to prevent child re-renders
- **Pure Components**: Use React.memo for functional components and PureComponent for class components
- **Render Optimization**: Avoid creating objects, arrays, or functions in render methods

### State Management Performance
- **State Splitting**: Split large state objects to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **State Updates**: Use functional updates for state that depends on previous state
- **Context Optimization**: Split large contexts into smaller, focused contexts
- **State Normalization**: Normalize complex state structures for efficient updates
- **Immutable Updates**: Use immutable update patterns to trigger re-renders efficiently

### List Rendering Optimization
- **Key Props**: Use stable, unique keys for list items (avoid array indices)
- **Virtualization**: Implement virtual scrolling for large lists (react-window, react-virtualized)
- **Windowing**: Use windowing techniques to render only visible items
- **Pagination**: Implement proper pagination for large datasets
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Use infinite scrolling with proper loading states

### Bundle Optimization
- **Code Splitting**: Use React.lazy() and Suspense for route-based code splitting
- **Dynamic Imports**: Use dynamic imports for component-level code splitting
- **Tree Shaking**: Ensure proper tree shaking to eliminate dead code
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use webpack-bundle-analyzer to identify large dependencies
- **Dependency Optimization**: Remove unused dependencies and optimize imports

## Advanced Performance Techniques

### Concurrent Features (React 18+)
- **Suspense**: Use Suspense for loading states and data fetching
- **Concurrent Rendering**: Leverage concurrent features for better user experience
- **Transitions**: Use startTransition for non-urgent updates
- **Deferred Values**: Use useDeferredValue for expensive UI updates
- **Automatic Batching**: Leverage automatic batching for multiple state updates

### Memory Management
- **Memory Leaks**: Clean up subscriptions, timeouts, and event listeners
- **Garbage Collection**: Avoid memory leaks in useEffect cleanup functions
- **Large Object Handling**: Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- **Image Optimization**: Implement lazy loading and proper image sizing
- **Event Listener Cleanup**: Remove event listeners in useEffect cleanup

### Network Performance
- **Data Fetching**: Implement efficient data fetching with caching strategies
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate API requests
- **Caching**: Use React Query, SWR, or custom caching solutions
- **Prefetching**: Implement data prefetching for better perceived performance
- **Optimistic Updates**: Use optimistic updates for better user experience

## Performance Monitoring & Analysis

### React DevTools Profiler
- **Component Profiling**: Use React DevTools Profiler to identify slow components
- **Render Analysis**: Analyze component render times and frequency
- **Commit Analysis**: Examine individual commits and their performance impact
- **Flamegraph**: Use flamegraph to visualize component render hierarchy
- **Interactions**: Track user interactions and their performance impact

### Performance Metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor LCP, FID, and CLS metrics
- **Time to Interactive**: Measure and optimize time to interactive
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize JavaScript bundle sizes
- **Memory Usage**: Track memory usage and identify memory leaks
- **Network Requests**: Monitor API call performance and optimization

### Performance Testing
- **Lighthouse Audits**: Regular Lighthouse performance audits
- **Bundle Analysis**: Continuous bundle size monitoring
- **Performance Regression Testing**: Automated performance regression detection
- **Load Testing**: Test application performance under load
- **User Experience Testing**: Measure real user performance metrics

## Optimization Best Practices

### Component Design
- **Component Splitting**: Split large components into smaller, focused components
- **Prop Optimization**: Minimize prop changes and use stable references
- **Conditional Rendering**: Use conditional rendering efficiently
- **Fragment Usage**: Use React.Fragment to avoid unnecessary DOM nodes
- **Portal Usage**: Use portals for modals and overlays to avoid layout thrashing

### State Optimization
- **Local State**: Keep state as local as possible to minimize re-renders
- **Derived State**: Use useMemo for expensive derived state calculations
- **State Updates**: Batch state updates to minimize re-renders
- **Context Optimization**: Use context splitting and optimization techniques
- **External State**: Optimize external state management (Redux, Zustand)

### Rendering Optimization
- **Avoid Inline Styles**: Use CSS classes instead of inline styles
- **CSS-in-JS Optimization**: Optimize CSS-in-JS libraries for performance
- **Animation Performance**: Use CSS transforms and opacity for animations
- **Layout Thrashing**: Avoid layout thrashing with proper DOM manipulation
- **Paint Optimization**: Minimize paint operations and use hardware acceleration

## Performance Tools & Libraries

### Performance Libraries
- **React Query**: Efficient data fetching and caching
- **SWR**: Lightweight data fetching with caching
- **React Window**: Virtualization for large lists
- **React Virtualized**: Advanced virtualization solutions
- **Why Did You Render**: Debug unnecessary re-renders

### Monitoring Tools
- **React DevTools**: Component profiling and debugging
- **Lighthouse**: Performance auditing and optimization
